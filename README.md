## REMEMBER
```
 - Good software design has high cohesion and low coupling.
 - 

```
## PRO TIPS when preparing for an interview
```
- Think of examples for the most important concepts and have them ready-to-go - PREPARATION IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS!
- If you have any questions that you did not answer fully in a previous interview - do some research and make sure you know them prior to your next one.
- Practice with friends / colleagues.
- Get your theoretical knowledge right - you should be feeling confident explaining all concepts in English + using the right terminology.
- Focus on answering the questions that you are asked; don't simply say everything you know on the topic.
- Always consider edge cases, exceptions, JS-specific concepts.
